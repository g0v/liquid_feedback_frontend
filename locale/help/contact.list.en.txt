=personal list of contacts=

In order to find other members more quickly, you can add them to your personal list of contacts. On the profile page of the respective member you will find a link for doing so.

If you publish a contact, others can see this member as listed on your list of contacts. Published contacts are on this page marked with a green icon, hidden contacts with a grey icon. A click on the icon toggles the state.

Contacts can be deleted again by clicking on the red icon.

**Important:** For improved ease-of-use your list of contacts will be shown to you when you delegate. In order to delegate to a member, you must first add him or her to your contacts. Removing a contact does not revoke the delegation, though.
